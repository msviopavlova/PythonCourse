#while loop works as long as the condition is True, when it reaches False the loop terminates. and execution continuos with the code after the loop.
#we dont have any more code underneath and besides the loop so the program ended as well. ' \


# if we are using while we need to define the variable first. otherwise it doesnt know ehn to start or stop. when we use FOR we do not need to do that as FOR var in defined.
# when using while we need to say somewhere when the condition decomes false or the while loop will not terminate.
