activity = input("What would you like to do today?  ")

if "cinema" not in activity.casefold(): #casefold converts a string to lowercase /this function is better in use while comparing strings instead of LOWERCASE function dut its handing letters better like in German there are upper case letters thata are in the middle of the word
    print("But I want to go to cinema")
